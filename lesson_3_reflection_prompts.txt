When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want to share your code to the community. Also when you want to
    collaborate with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Manually pulling changes is better than automatically so you have more
    control with your local repository. There maybe times that the changes on
    GitHub consists of bugs, so it is up to the user if they want to pull it
    or not.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are used to clone other repositories on GitHub to your GitHub.
    Cloning is when you want to copy the repository on your local machine.
    Branches are used to create a commit outside of the master branch.

    We fork a repo when we want to use and edit other users repo and have the
    files to our account. Cloning the repo is usually done after forking to
    create a copy to our local machine. Branch is used when we want to make
    changes like add features to the master branch but still keeping the
    master branch

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

	So that you can modify and merge you current work locally before you push
	it.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Now that I know about how collaborating works with Git/GitHub,
    collaborating without it would be a pain. It would be harder to find the
    differences with the codes specially with big projects. Honestly, I cannot
    think of any easier way to do this without using Git/GitHub

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    We are collaborating with other people that is why we do our changes
    on a separate branch. Making sure that everything is reviewed before
    merging to the master branch is always a must.
